            <p class="max-w-md">
              After graduation, I intend to work as a data analyst, with the end
              goal of being a data scientist. Working as a data analyst will
              solidify the foundations needed to become a data scientist. A data
              scientist demands expertise in data analytics, mathematical
              literacy, knowledge of algorithms, and complex problem-solving
              skills in various domains. My WIL placement exposed me to new
              branches of mathematics (e.g., interval arithmetic), put my
              problem-solving skills to practice, and required the application
              of data analytics techniques with the understanding of algorithms
              being an essential skill. I learnt to be a lifelong learner
              through independent research and increased my breadth and depth of
              knowledge by partaking in the WIL placement. The WIL placement
              mimics the job scope of a data scientist by posing me with a
              challenging problem with no existing solution. Working with the
              industry partner has been a fun, enriching process and he taught
              me the importance of communication and collaboration. The
              placement has inspired me to embark on self-initiated projects
              where I explore existing optimisation problems in IT (e.g.,
              Knapsack problem). I believe in upskilling and constantly
              improving, and thus I have crafted my learning plan after
              graduation to differentiate myself from competitors. The WIL
              placement showed me my strengths and weaknesses, and the
              reflective process has made me self-actualise - I learnt what will
              fulfil me career-wise and personally. I will improve on soft and
              technical skills to prepare for the workplace.

            <p class="max-w-md">
              I am completing my master‚Äôs in information technology with a
              specialisation in Data Analytics. I garnered interest in data
              analytics and data science due to the need for analysing data,
              visualising results, and applying mathematics. I am most
              passionate about deciphering data to obtain insights and create
              beautiful visualisations. My master‚Äôs taught me core data
              analytics skills ‚Äì coding in popular languages (R, python),
              visualisation tools, and methods to find meaning in data. I have
              completed several data analysis projects and applied IT project
              lifecycle skills. Apart from technical skills, I had to learn key
              business terms to align my insights with business goals and
              communicate them to a diverse audience. Besides analytics, I have
              always been fond of mathematics. Although implicit, I had
              opportunities to improve mathematical literacy through coursework.
              Overall, the master's course has taught me the intricacies of the
              IT field, and the scope of knowledge to gain.

              Knowing when to be independent
            </h6>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              My placement supervisor instructed me to read one academic paper
              to understand the problem context and explore interval arithmetic
              using Python. Initially, I felt motivated and responsible for
              structuring my learning process as no detailed content structure
              was provided, unlike in other courses. I self-studied algorithms,
              delved into mathematics and read academic papers related to my
              placement topic. I felt overwhelmed and incompetent as my existing
              knowledge and skills were inadequate to understand parts of the
              project. However, after talking with my placement supervisor, I
              understood that it is natural to lack some technical skills and
              knowledge at the commencement of a job. While learning new things
              will always be a part of any new job, I have learnt the necessity
              of focusing on essential points with sufficient depth and breadth
              without delving deep into everything. To improve my ability to
              plan learning tasks without going off-course, I will practice
              using notetaking and task management software like Notion to list
              the skills and knowledge needed, followed by a course of action to
              complete these tasks. This way, I can have an overview of what I
              have learnt and the remaining gaps in knowledge that needs
              addressing without getting side-tracked.
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              When I did not understand the method to apply interval arithmetic,
              I kept on researching on the Internet to find answers. I felt
              obligated to be an independent learner, who must decipher and
              solve problems with minimal guidance. I learnt that I had a
              misconception ‚Äì that asking for assistance undermines my ability
              to conduct tasks assigned to me and makes me reliant. My
              reluctance to ask my supervisor questions due to a desire to be
              independent hindered the progress of my placement by several
              weeks. When I finally communicated my struggles to my placement
              supervisor, his response made me realise that mentors are willing
              to assist and share their knowledge. Moving forward, as I start my
              career in IT, I shall ask teammates and supervisors questions,
              when necessary, instead of ‚Äúsuffering silently‚Äù and wasting time
              on futile attempts. In any workplace, I will face strict deadlines
              to produce deliverables to circumvent financial penalties. Hence,
              I must not hesitate to seek help merely because I wish to prove my
              independence. I have learnt that there must be a balance between
              communicating my struggles to someone who can assist me, with
              being proactive in learning on my own. Additionally, knowing how
              to communicate these needs is a crucial skill, as asking vague
              questions will cause miscommunication.

              Niche field problems
            </h6>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              The most surprising insight I gained is how important it is to
              learn from field experts about topics less explored. I have long
              held the belief that in the field of IT, everything there is to
              know is well-documented on the Internet and a simple Google search
              will give me an influx of relevant information. When I searched
              for Interval Arithmetic libraries and their applications, I did
              find several options. However, as I explored these libraries, it
              became evident to me that some of them are underdeveloped, not
              maintained or irrelevant, given how uncommon it is to use in
              coding in the context of my placement goals. This challenged my
              assumptions and made me aware of my reliance on the Internet as
              the only source of knowledge. My supervisor suggested I explore
              PyIbex (python library) which did not appear in the top 10 pages
              of my Google search results. I was surprised that PyIbex did not
              appear as a top search, but my supervisor was aware of its
              existence and relevance. I learnt that years of experience and
              exposure gave him knowledge and insight that I cannot gain by
              doing simple Internet searches and reading. This realisation
              opened my eyes to the option of using my supervisor‚Äôs experience
              as a crucial source of relevant information, as self-exploration
              on the Internet will not always provide me with the exact
              information I need in a reasonable timeframe. In future jobs, I
              will ask field experts or experienced mentors appropriate
              questions to help speed up my learning process. During meetings
              with the supervisor, I listened to his explanations and did not
              know what questions to ask to maximise my time with him. After the
              meeting, I realised I did have questions but felt doubtful about
              the quality of my questions and thus, was hesitant to ask. I shall
              learn to plan for meetings with a list of questions and how to
              record information conveyed to me. I learnt that it is not a
              viable option to expect experts to spend time explaining in
              detail, so asking the right questions is a valuable skill I intend
              to polish. I intend to read books (e.g., ‚ÄúThe Art of Asking‚Äù by
              Terry Fadem) and articles on asking questions during meetings to
              gain this skill.

              Algorithm Construction + Mathematics
            </h6>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              I was offered the placement by Dr Yong Wu as I had experience with
              a relevant coding language (python), data analysis and machine
              learning. I was required to work on validating optimisation
              solution for a packing problem by using/creating an appropriate
              algorithm. I accepted the placement as I had an opportunity to
              practice these skills and learn additional technical skills. Prior
              to the placement, I had knowledge of some algorithm types,
              primarily sorting algorithms. The algorithm needed in this
              placement was a search algorithm. My placement supervisor told me
              to learn about Branch and Bound algorithm (B&B) as it is most
              relevant. While researching on the uses of B&B, I got exposure to
              dynamic algorithms. I learnt that B&B is a merger of search and
              dynamic algorithm. Overall, my knowledge of algorithm types and
              uses has increased exponentially through reading and researching.
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              When my placement supervisor told me to use B&B in the solution,
              my approach was to find an existing B&B algorithm I could
              implement on the packing problem I was given. I spent considerable
              time searching existing libraries and attempting to implement it.
              I then learnt that most of these B&B algorithms are created for
              very specific use cases, unlike general-use algorithms (e.g.,
              Support Vector Machine) that I had experience using. The skills I
              had to apply were an extension of my prior knowledge, but very
              different in execution. Previously, I had taken general-function
              algorithm codes from existing libraries like Scikit-learn and
              implemented them on large datasets. This meant a writing a few
              lines of codes, with the focus being on processing data and
              interpretation of results. The aim would be to obtain insights on
              existing data. However, this placement needed me to create such an
              algorithm and create data to test the algorithm. While both
              situations dealt with algorithms and data, I found the process of
              creating to be exponentially more complex than implementing. I
              should have focused on learning about how algorithms are built,
              instead of attempting to carry out the same techniques I had done
              in other courses.
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              The process of simulating the packing problem and creating dataset
              was yet another challenge. I had to understand the properties of
              circles and create mathematical equations to describe the packing
              process. Data analytics does require various branches of
              mathematics (e.g., statistics) in algorithms and discovering
              insights from data. The improvement in mathematical literacy and
              algorithm use will make me a better data analyst.

              Coding skills: Python
            </h6>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              While algorithm-use and python programming are intertwined, since
              algorithms can be written in Python language, the skills I needed
              for each is quite different. To be able to implement the best
              algorithm, the focus is on the results of implementation on
              datasets, that translates to useful insights. The writing of codes
              to implement algorithm is significantly simplified through
              detailed codes description provided in libraries. Coding in this
              context required me to be focused on the language syntax (e.g.,
              debugging when I had errors). To be able to write programs well, I
              needed to be methodological and translate logical processes (i.e.,
              optimising packing circles problem) into lines of code with
              correct syntax. I realised I could be good at implementing
              algorithms without being as good at coding. However, coding skills
              will make implementing algorithms an effortless process. This
              challenged me as the one of the key tasks was to write codes for a
              program.
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              I proceeded to look at over 300 lines of code written for a
              specific implementation of B&B algorithm. This was the most
              eye-opening experience ‚Äì I did not once think about the complexity
              in coding logic of an algorithm, despite having used numerous
              algorithms. While I had experience coding programs, they were
              relatively simple tasks with singular functionality (e.g., a
              program to calculate area based on user input). The logic of
              algorithms considers numerous calculations and situations. I
              obtained a skeletal of what my B&B coding logic should contain by
              analysing the codes. Additionally, I had to re-read Python class
              methods to understand and use it. Initially I found coding
              challenging, but as I practiced writing, the syntax became more
              intuitive. While I have become more comfortable and faster in
              coding with Python, I recognise that more practice is needed to
              master it. To gain confidence and versatility in my coding skills,
              I shall practice coding to solve python problems (e.g., LeetCode
              problems).

              >
              In the placement, I had to create an algorithm, create
              visualisations, fabricate testing data, understand interval
              arithmetic (mathematics) and lastly, understand the packing
              problem (domain knowledge) to optimise it. Although I had not
              successfully created the optimization algorithm, I had a chance to
              practise many skills, which is the first step to being an
              excellent data analyst.

              Master's vs Bachelor's
            </h6>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              For my bachelor‚Äôs degree, I studied chemistry out of interest in
              the subject. During my undergraduate course, I gained a breadth of
              knowledge on many subject matters. Additionally, I focused on
              doing my assignments to obtain good grades and went through the
              routine of attending classes without processing what it meant to
              me in my career. After graduation, I realised that I wish to do
              something that was not related to chemistry. I realised my
              decision-making was flawed ‚Äì choosing subject based on interests
              and not as a career option.
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              My motivation to do master‚Äôs degree is aligned with my career
              plans of being an IT professional ‚Äì a data analyst. I need to
              master IT skills and doing my master‚Äôs degree meant I gain
              expertise in a structured way. My shift in focus had been from
              exploring various subjects, to mastering one. While not part of
              the coursework, I have started reading articles and news on IT
              field to stay updated. I learnt to be more practical in my
              learning approach.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              Another change in my approach has been going from relying on
              course materials as my main source of knowledge (during
              bachelor‚Äôs), to doing my own research and independently learning
              outside the course to supplement and consolidate my
              skills/knowledge. I recognise that self-improvement means to be
              proactive in learning from a variety of resources without being
              instructed to do so. In my workplace, I would be required to learn
              new languages, software, and analytical techniques, since there is
              constant progress in the IT field. This ability to be resourceful
              will help me constantly upgrade my knowledge/skillset to be a
              better analyst and adapt to changes in the job market.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-xl font-bold">Teamwork</h5>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              Projects in my undergraduate studies were simpler, and the teams
              were bigger. The impact of each member‚Äôs contribution appeared
              insignificant, and I found myself capable of doing the entire
              project independently. However, the nature of team projects in
              master‚Äôs program in IT have been technical, complex, and sometimes
              tedious. Collaborating with each other in small teams of meant
              greater workload for each member. The academic rigour of master‚Äôs
              has emphasised to me the importance of task segregation and
              communicating both struggles and progress. Furthermore, we
              contributed our knowledge to the team by filling on one another‚Äôs
              skills/knowledge gaps. I found that being older, the need to have
              a team leader who takes charge over the project is less, while
              during undergraduate, it helped give the team a sense of
              direction. In master‚Äôs, everyone was a leader and self-directed.
              My teammates in master‚Äôs programme are matured with many
              commitments (e.g., work, children) and this is different from my
              teammates in bachelor‚Äôs, who were full-time students and more
              available. I learnt to be respectful of my teammates‚Äô time as they
              are busy. My experiences in group IT projects will allow me to
              work on complicated tasks independently, but also communicate
              struggles and update members on progress to complete group tasks
              efficiently.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-xl font-bold">Complex problem solving</h5>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              Projects during bachelor‚Äôs lacked real-life context applications
              or problems. They were mainly theoretical with emphasis on
              presentation skills. The projects done in master‚Äôs had greater
              academic rigour and more complex with high-level thinking skills
              being needed to solve ‚Äì e.g., the WIL placement incorporated
              mathematics, coding, and contextual understanding for building the
              solution. To develop these problem-solving skills, I had to be an
              independent learner who makes sound judgement and decisions.
              Sometimes it took wrong approaches to learn the right ones, and
              this increased the depth of my understanding and ability to solve
              more efficiently. I will have to tackle complex problems in data
              analysis domain, and issues unrelated to job tasks in the
              workplace, making this an important skill.

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              I have travelled to 25 countries, with solo travels in 18
              countries. I would travel overseas for one to three months at a
              time during my vacations. I had to research, plan, and prepare
              extensively before the trips. I gained planning and time
              management skills that I can apply to projects at work. The stakes
              have been high (often financially) if I was late or had planned
              something wrongly during travels. In a workplace, if I am late in
              delivering results, there could be financial penalties too. During
              travels, I had to manage my finances and make informed choices
              (e.g., where to stay) to ensure the trip ran smoothly. Solo
              travels taught me to be independent and manage every aspect of
              life by myself. This sharpened my decision-making skills as I had
              to weigh options every day. In a workplace, I must make informed
              decisions independently and plan accordingly to deliver projects
              timely.
            </p>

            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              In unfamiliar places, events I did not plan for or anticipate
              happened (e.g., train breakdown). I had to be comfortable with
              uncertainty and prepared for the unexpected. I learnt to handle
              difficult situations by myself by fine-tuning my judgments and
              being quick-thinking while stressed. In a workplace,
              stress/pressure would be inevitable, and my capability to make
              decisions while stressed will allow me to cope in a crisis (e.g.,
              a project failure). It taught me to be a risk-taker and forced me
              out of my comfort zone. Sometimes at work, it is essential to be
              willing to take calculated risks and explore.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              I met people of various cultures who did not speak a common
              language. I had to communicate with them (e.g., asking for
              directions). My social and communication skills improved as I
              learnt to talk to strangers and understand them through verbal and
              non-verbal methods (e.g., drawing maps to convey directions). I
              discovered that understanding people goes beyond verbal
              communication. My field is technical and non-IT personnel may not
              understand my verbal explanations. I now appreciate the value of
              conveying my data analytics results through visualisations.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md md:text-lg">
              When I travelled with people, sometimes we had different
              interests. I had to communicate my expectations and learn to make
              compromises. I now understand that communication is vital to
              prevent misunderstandings. At work, I must understand the project
              deliverables by communicating with my teammates and clients,
              ensuring the results align with the client‚Äôs expectations.
